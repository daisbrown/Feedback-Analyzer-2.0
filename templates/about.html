        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>
            This application provides a web interface to view and analyze user feedback
            that has been logged to JSONL files stored in an Azure Storage container.
            <!-- Removed mention of authentication -->
        </p>
        <p>Here's a summary of the process:</p>
        <ul>
            <!-- Removed authentication bullet point -->
            <li><strong>Containerization:</strong> The entire application runs as a Docker container based on an Ubuntu image, ensuring a consistent environment for deployment.</li>
            <li><strong>Web Framework:</strong> It utilizes Flask, a lightweight Python web framework, to handle web requests and render pages.</li>
            <li><strong>Azure Connection:</strong> It securely connects to a specific Azure Storage Account container using a Container SAS URL. This URL, which includes permissions and an expiry date, is provided via an environment file (<code>azure.env</code> or application settings) for security. The application requires SAS permissions for both <strong>List</strong> (to find files) and <strong>Read</strong> (to download file content).</li>
            <li><strong>Scheduled Data Fetching:</strong> A background scheduler (APScheduler) runs every 15 minutes within the application. This task scans the configured Azure container, including any subfolders, looking for files that start with <code>feedback_log_</code> and end with <code>.jsonl</code>.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Processing & Storage:</strong> For each matching file found, the application downloads its content. It reads the file line by line, parsing each line as a JSON object. It extracts key fields like ID, timestamp, user details, feedback type, and content. This extracted data, along with the source Azure file path, is then inserted into a local SQLite database file (<code>feedback.db</code>).</li>
            <li><strong>Incremental Updates:</strong> To ensure efficiency and avoid duplicates, the application uses an <code>INSERT OR IGNORE</code> database command based on the feedback entry's unique <code>id</code> (which is set as the Primary Key). This means that even though all files are scanned, only feedback entries with IDs not already present in the database are actually added during each 15-minute cycle.</li>
            <li><strong>Web Interface:</strong> The main page queries the SQLite database and displays the collected feedback data in a sortable, searchable table. It uses the Jinja2 templating engine (with Flask) and custom CSS for styling, including the company logo and a modern theme.</li>
            <li><strong>Features:</strong> Users can sort the data by clicking on most column headers and can filter the results by typing into the search bar, which checks multiple fields for matches.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The primary technologies involved are Python 3.9+, Flask, SQLite3, APScheduler, the <code>azure-storage-blob</code> SDK, HTML5, CSS3, Jinja2, Gunicorn (as the web server within Docker), and Docker itself.</p>
